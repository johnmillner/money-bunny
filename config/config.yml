# amount of buying power that should be risked on any one trade - default 1% (0.01)
# scenario: buying power is 100$, the max risk any one trade should have if lost is 1$

# when setting the stop loss, a minimum floor should be set if the stock is fast falling - defaults  50% (0.5)
# scenario: planning on buying a stock at 10$/share, stopLoss begins when price hits 9$,
#   stopLossMax at 50% means it will accept sells down to 8.5$
#   in the event the stock is falling so fast and it goes below 8.5$ - it will not sell and instead wait for it come back up

# the amount of the total account (including margin) to be played with - default 75% (0.75) - max 1.00
# scenario: buying power is gathered from alpaca directly, and it will include a 4x margin
#   by selecting .75, you are using 3x margin - and keeping the other 1x as buffer during fluctuations
#   if not wanting to use margin at all, please set the value to 0.25 or less

# when scanning for stocks to choose from, we want to target stocks with enough risk/reward to be worth trading
#   the amount of exposure is calculated from the #risk field and the stocks latest ATR value
#   this tolerance is how much it can fluctuate from an ideally risky stock - defaults to 10% (0.1)
# scenario: a stock is estimated to have an max risk and reward of 10$ and 15$ respectively, but we'd need to spend 15k$
#   that is not worth the risk, and it would be better to focus on a more risky stock
#   on the flipside, there is an extremely volatile stock that we may need to avoid because we might not be able to get
#   into and out of the stock in good time
